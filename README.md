# Smart Traffic Control with AI

A simple yet powerful system that uses artificial intelligence to control traffic lights and reduce congestion. Think of it as teaching multiple intersections to work together to keep traffic flowing smoothly.

## What This Does

Instead of having traffic lights that just follow a fixed timer, this system uses **federated learning** to make them smarter. Each intersection learns from its own traffic patterns and shares knowledge with other intersections - but without sharing any personal data about drivers.

**Key Benefits:**
- 🚦 **Smarter Traffic Lights**: AI learns the best timing for each intersection
- 🔄 **Collaborative Learning**: Intersections share knowledge to improve city-wide traffic
- 🛡️ **Privacy Safe**: No personal data is shared between intersections
- 📊 **Real Results**: See actual improvements in waiting times and traffic flow

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Each intersection** runs its own traffic simulation and AI agent
2. **The AI learns** the best timing by watching traffic patterns
3. **Intersections share** their learning (but not personal data) with a central server
4. **Everyone gets smarter** as the system learns from all intersections together

## What You Need

### Software Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or newer** (download from python.org)
- **SUMO Traffic Simulator** (download from sumo.dlr.de)

### Quick Setup
1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Verify SUMO is working:**
   ```bash
   sumo --version
   ```

3. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

## Getting Started

### Quick single-client smoke test
```bash
python train_federated.py --mode single --sumo-config sumo_configs/intersection.sumocfg --gui --show-phase-console
```

### Federated training (server + clients)

- Server (1 terminal):
```bash
python train_federated.py --mode server --num-rounds 10 --min-clients 2 --server-address localhost:8080
```

- Clients (N terminals):
```bash
python client.py --client-id client_1 --sumo-config sumo_configs/osm_client1.sumocfg --server-address localhost:8080 --gui
python client.py --client-id client_2 --sumo-config sumo_configs/osm_client2.sumocfg --server-address localhost:8080 --gui
```

Remove `--gui` to run headless. When GUI is enabled, you'll see signal colors and live phase switching.

### Local multi-client simulation (no external server)

You can also run a simple two-client federated simulation in a single process:

```bash
python train_federated.py --mode multi --num-rounds 15 --results-dir results_4lane
```

- **`--results-dir`**: controls where all JSON logs for this run are stored (e.g. `results_3lane`, `results_4lane`, `results_5lane`).

## Understanding the Results

By default, the system automatically saves results to the `results/` folder, but you can override this with `--results-dir`:
- Example folders for different intersection types:
  - `results_3lane` – experiments on 3‑approach intersection
  - `results_4lane` – experiments on 4‑approach (standard) intersection
  - `results_5lane` – experiments on 5‑approach intersection

Each results directory contains per‑round JSON files for each client (e.g. `client_1_round_4_eval.json`, `client_1_round_4_detailed.json`):
- **Training progress**: How well the AI is learning
- **Performance metrics**: Waiting times, queue lengths, traffic flow
- **Visual charts**: Easy-to-read graphs showing improvements

## Multi-lane Intersection Experiments (3 / 4 / 5 Lanes)

To compare different intersection geometries (e.g. 3‑lane, 4‑lane, 5‑lane) with two clients each:

1. **Run separate experiments**, each with its own results folder (examples):
   - 3‑lane:
     ```bash
     python train_federated.py --mode multi --num-rounds 15 --results-dir results_3lane
     ```
   - 4‑lane:
     ```bash
     python train_federated.py --mode multi --num-rounds 15 --results-dir results_4lane
     ```
   - 5‑lane:
     ```bash
     python train_federated.py --mode multi --num-rounds 15 --results-dir results_5lane
     ```

2. **Configure scenario folders** in `plot_client_lane_waiting.py` if your folder names differ:
   ```python
   SCENARIOS = {
       "3_lane": "results_3lane",
       "4_lane": "results_4lane",
       "5_lane": "results_5lane",
   }
   DEFAULT_CLIENT_IDS = ["client_1", "client_2"]
   ```

3. **Generate all graphs in one command** from inside `traffic32/`:
   ```bash
   python run_viz.py
   ```

   This will create, for each scenario and each client:
   - Old `run_viz` graphs: average waiting time per vehicle and congestion vs aggregation weight.
   - New detailed graphs: lane waiting time, intersection waiting time, average queue length per round, and per‑lane queue length over rounds.

## Technical Details (For Developers)

### AI Agent (DQN)
- **Architecture**: 3-layer neural network (128 → 128 → 64 neurons)
- **Learning**: Uses experience replay and target networks
- **Exploration**: Starts random, becomes smarter over time
- **Memory**: Remembers 10,000 traffic situations

### Traffic Simulation (SUMO)
- **State**: Monitors vehicle count, queue length, and waiting time
- **Actions**: Controls traffic light phases
- **Safety**: Minimum green times and collision prevention
- **Realism**: Based on real traffic patterns

### Federated Learning (Flower)
- **Privacy**: Only model weights are shared, never raw data
- **Aggregation**: Server combines learning from all intersections
- **Scalability**: Works with any number of intersections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SUMO not found" error:**
- Make sure SUMO is installed and added to your system PATH
- Test with: `sumo --version`

**"GUI not opening":**
- Try running without `--gui` first
- Make sure `sumo-gui` is installed

**"Python import errors":**
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you're using Python 3.8+

**"Server connection failed":**
- Check that the server is running first
- Make sure all clients use the same server address

### Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Make sure all requirements are installed
3. Try running the simple test first: `python train_federated.py --mode single`
